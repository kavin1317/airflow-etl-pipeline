# ETL Pipeline with Airflow

A beginner-friendly **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using **Apache Airflow** and **Docker**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple ETL workflow:

* **Extract**: Reads sample customer purchase data
* **Transform**: Adds tax calculations and purchase categories
* **Load**: Stores processed data into:

  * A CSV file
  * A SQLite database

The pipeline is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow** and containerized with **Docker**.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Setup Project Directory

```bash
mkdir airflow-etl-pipeline
cd airflow-etl-pipeline
mkdir -p dags logs plugins data
```

---

### 2️⃣ Add Required Files

Place the following files:

* `extract_transform_load.py` → inside `dags/`
* `docker-compose.yml` → project root
* `requirements.txt` → project root
* `.env` → project root
* `.gitignore` → project root
* `README.md` → project root

---

### 3️⃣ Start Airflow

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:

* Airflow Webserver
* Airflow Scheduler
* Required services (e.g., database)

---

### 4️⃣ Access Airflow UI

Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Login credentials:

```
Username: airflow
Password: airflow
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the ETL Pipeline

1. Toggle the DAG to **ON**
2. Click the **Play (▶) button**
3. Select **Trigger DAG**

The pipeline will execute the ETL workflow.

## 📊 View Results

### 🔹 View Transformed CSV Data

```bash
cat data/transformed_data.csv
```

---

### 🔹 View Data in SQLite Database

```bash
sqlite3 data/etl_database.db
SELECT * FROM customer_purchases;
.exit
```

---

## 🛑 Stop Airflow

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Check Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs airflow-scheduler
```

### Restart Services

```bash
docker-compose restart
```
